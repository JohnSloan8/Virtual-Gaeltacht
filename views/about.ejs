    <p>The Virtual Gaeltacht is a free, online platform for learners of Irish to meet and chat.</p>
    <p>Learners take part in group conversations through animated avatars, controlling gaze, facial expressions and gestures. This combines recent advances in web application technology with the latest research in language learning pedagogy. Emphasis in interactions is placed on three important, social aspects of language acquisition: <i>emotion</i>, <i>expression</i> and <i>engagement</i>.

    <p>The primary aim of the Virtual Gaeltacht is to provide Irish learners with easy, remote access to a vibrant community of speakers.</p> 
    <p>A lack of speaking opportunities hinders the progress of many Irish learners. Few have the chance to spend time in the remaining Gaeltacht regions to experience life 'as Gaeilge'. Alternatives have sprung up to fill this gap, including the Pop-up Gaeltacht, Meetups, and exercise classes in Irish. These are fantastic and much-loved initiatives, but learners are missing out on casual encounters, unburdened by set locations and times. The Virtual Gaeltacht aims to be the platform where these informal interactions can occur.</p>
